### Car Renting Service

#Introduction

Car renting service is a mobile focused application that will help people, in a short period of time, to find a car.
The application facilitates the car renting by avoiding the usual bureaucratic procedures that are ecountered in traditional car renting providers. 

* This project theme was chosen because in it's creation the latest technologies could be easily implemented.
* Because the average time of a car sitting idle is around 85 procent. That often results in the lack of parking spaces and congestions on the roads. 
* The owners could make their cars available for rent which will result in a passive income as well facilitate a greater mobility in the cities.
